{"name":"DBCraigslist","tagline":"a simple version of Craigslist","body":"# [DBCraigslist](https://craigslist-clone.herokuapp.com) <-- Try It !\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a simple version of Craigslist.  This is also my first\r\nweb application that uses multiple models.\r\n\r\nThe web app used a Sinatra framework.\r\n\r\n## Learning Competencies\r\n\r\n* Build a wireframe to model application views\r\n* Use Active Record Associations\r\n* Implement all four parts of [CRUD][]: create, read, update, and delete.\r\n* Use the MVC pattern in web applications with proper allocation of code and responsibilities to each layer\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nWe're going to build a simple version of Craigslist.  This will be your first\r\nweb application that uses multiple models.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is not substantially different than a command-line\r\nversion.  Instead of reading in command-line arguments, we read in URL\r\nparameters.  Instead of printing to the console, we print HTML and CSS.\r\n\r\nWe'll only have two models in a one-to-many relationship; no different than\r\nyour command-line TODO app.\r\n\r\nThe challenge repo includes a Sinatra skeleton as usual.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n* Create, Read, Update, Delete ([CRUD][])\r\n* [Wikipedia: Wireframe][wireframe]\r\n\r\n[CRUD]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\r\n[wireframe]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe\r\n","google":"UA-51174308-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
